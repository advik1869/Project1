<b>Today I woke up excited because I had planned a trip to the beach.</b><br><br>
<i>The weather felt perfect the moment I stepped outside.</i><br><br>
<mark>I packed my bag with sunscreen, a red hat, and my bright blue towel.</mark><br><br>
<p style="background-color:powderblue;">When I arrived, the waves were crashing with a steady rhythm.</p><br><br>
<sub>The sand was warm and felt soft beneath my feet.</sub><br><br>
<sup>I watched children building tiny sandcastles near the shore.</sup><br><br>
<del>A group of friends played volleyball and their laughter echoed all around.</del><br><br>
<ins>I sat down and read a mystery novel while the cool breeze brushed past me.</ins><br><br>
<b><p style="color:red;">After a while, I took a walk and collected smooth seashells.</p></b><br><br>
<p style="font-size:300%;">Before leaving, I watched the sunset paint the sky in golden shades.</p><br><br>
