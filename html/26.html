It began with cold lasagna, prepared the night before with a belief that more cheese solves most problems. In the kitchen, a seemingly innocent microwave was about to cause chaos. <br>Upon attempting to heat the lasagna, an ominous whirrrrrrrrr-clunk was heard, and the microwave started moving erratically<br>. Smoke billowed, the smoke detector blared, and the cat, Mr. Whiskers, fled into the curtains. Amidst the confusion, a dishtowel caught fire, leading to a frantic dousing in the sink. A neighbor, Gary, arrived with a fire extinguisher. After the commotion subsided, the lasagna was ruined and the kitchen was a mess.
